.SYNOPSIS
    Downloads video(s) using yt-dlp with custom filename formatting.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script accepts two arguments:
      1. DownloadLocation - The folder where videos will be saved.
      2. Link - The URL of the video or playlist.
    
    It checks if the folder exists and creates it if not. It then checks if the link is a playlist 
    (by looking for "list=" in the URL) and sets the output template accordingly:
      - If a playlist: it prepends the videoâ€™s playlist index.
      - If not: it uses just the title.
    
    Finally, it builds and executes the yt-dlp command.
